::  sigil-symbols: svg symbols for phonemes, for use in /lib/sigil
::
::    the map is keyed by phoneme cords and contains lists of manxes,
::    intended to be wrapped up in an svg <g> for further processing.
::
::    shapes and default attributes sourced from:
::    https://github.com/urbit/sigil-js/blob/fdea06f/src/index.json
::
::NOTE  to reduce svg size, we exclude certain common/shared attributes.
::      we expect the /lib/sigil to wrap these elements in a <g> which sets
::      those attributes, letting them be inherited. they are as follows:
::        =fill    fg
::        =stroke  bg
::        =stroke-linecap  "square"
::        =stroke-width
::      we assume the defaults specified above, and only include those
::      attributes below if they deviate from those. (this includes adding
::      stroke="none" for elements whose original specification did not
::      include a stroke.)
::      unfortunately, the vector-effect attribute cannot be inherted by <g>
::      children, so we have to inline it for every element here.
::      for ease of change, we leave excluded attributes as comments here.
