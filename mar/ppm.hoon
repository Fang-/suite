::  ppm: portable pixel map, lowest common denominator color image file format
::
::    reference spec: http://davis.lbl.gov/Manuals/NETPBM/doc/ppm.html
::
::NOTE  for parsing from mime:
::      - only parses P6-variant ppm files
::      - does not support comments
::      - requires that contents match the given width/height
::      - supports maxvals > 2 bytes
::
::NOTE  for growing to mime:
::      - does not sanity check frame shape (ie consistent row width),
::      - and uses the first row to determine the width
::      - also does not sanity-check pixel values against the maxval,
::      - but will truncate values to be of a matching bytelength
::      - supports maxvals > 2 bytes
::
::TODO  resolve the sanity-check mismatch in the above.
::      files generated on the urbit should be parsable by the urbit!
